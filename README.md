## Overview

Created an employee directory with React. Broke up the application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Use

The user can:

  * Sort the table by any category

  * Filter the users by name
